__Some notes from testing a bit of metaprogramming for this somewhat proof-of-concept library. The Java compiler API is sorely lacking in the public availability of documentation department so trying to memorize it isn't very easy.__

1) composition rather than inheritance for complicated GUI systems<br><br>
"Inheritance is most useful for grouping related sets of concepts, identifying families of classes, and in general organizing the names and concepts that describe the domain. As we delve deeper into the implementation of a system, we may find that our original generalizations about the domain concepts, captured in our inheritance hierarchies, are beginning to shred. Donâ€™t be afraid to disassemble inheritance hierarchies into sets of complementary cooperating interfaces and components when the code leads you in that direction" <br> <br>
2) start off with stateless events/event handlers - worry about 2-way events later



#Important Javac classes to know:
- Obviously `JCTree`
- `com.sun.tools.javac.com.Lower`: Contains a perfect AST with full scope, iterators etc.
- `com.sun.tools.javac.comp.Env`: In the AST map - contains important data like top level compilation loc. etc.
- `com.sun.tools.javac.code.Symtab`: Contains default/Useful symbols like null, void, common exceptions (for compiler)
- `com.sun.tools.javac.code.TypeEnvs`: The Holy Grail of Javac AST - everything here. Need to use reflection to get this for easy navigation around tree because it's package private and no interface, sub/super, public field anywhere.
- `com.sun.tools.javac.comp.Resolve`: Algorithms for locating symbols in scope environment or even entire compilation unit!
- `com.sun.tools.javac.comp.TreeScanner`: Easily see contents/relationships between AST tree structures
- `com.sun.tools.javac.comp.JCTree.Tag`: Each node is tagged with more information, this also contains methods that denote information such as "isAssignmentOperation" (in obfuscated code ofc)
- `com.sun.tools.javac.comp.Flow`: Control flow algorithms on AST. From docs: "<b>Finally, local variable capture analysis (see CaptureAnalyzer) determines that local variables accessed within the scope of an inner class/lambda are either final or effectively-final"


___[Primary Javac Tree types cheat sheet](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/jdk/api/javac/tree/):___<br>
(I need this because it's difficult to think of the names of stuff when you're programming a program to program stuff)

| Name | Javac Trees/AST class | Usages | Example |
|  --- | :---: | :---------:|:----------------: |
|Operators| JCUnary | Assignment | = or ++ |
|Binary operation | JCBinary | Comparing data | if(1 > 2)
|Declaration| JCDeclaration | Declare a variable | int i; |
|Statement| JCStatement | Complete line of code | this.toString(); |
|Expression| JCExpressionStatement | Wrap these with ^^ | this.toString |
|Methods|JCMethodDef | Declare | this.toString |
|Class| JCClassDecl | class declaration| public class Pi{} |
|Method invocation|JCMethodInvokation| invoke a method (wrap in JCStatement or use with JCIdent) | this.toString() |
|Primitives| JCPrimitiveTypeTree | primitives (int, long)| 35 |
